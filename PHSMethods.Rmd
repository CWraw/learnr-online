## Introduction

Welcome to PHS Methods training. This course is designed as a self-led introduction to the internally developed `phsmethods` package for use in Public Health Scotland. Throughout this course there will be quizzes to test your knowledge and opportunities to modify and write R code. The course is split with a section for each function in the package.

### Overview

The package, `phsmethods`, can be used on desktop and server versions of RStudio. It contains functions for common analytical tasks in Public Health Scotland (PHS). The package is also intended to be in continuous development, with contributions to fixing typos, bugs, and even new functions are all very much encouraged. To learn more about contributing, see [this section on GitHub](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods#contributing-to-phsmethods).

These are the current functions in the package which are included in this training app. As more functions are added, the aim is to include them here too. As such, this training can be treated as modular and each section is self-contained:

[`age_group()`](#age_group) [`chi_check()`](#chi_check) [`chi_pad()`](#chi_pad) [`file_size()`](#file_size) [`fin_year()`](#fin_year) [`match_area()`](#match_area) [`postcode()`](#postcode) and the [quarters](#quarters) functions.


## age_group()

`age_group()` categorises ages into groups.


## chi_check()

`chi_check()` assesses the validity of a CHI number.


## chi_pad()

`chi_pad()` adds a leading zero (`0`) to nine-digit CHI numbers.


## file_size()

`file_size()` returns the names and sizes of files in a directory.


## fin_year()

`fin_year()` assigns a date to a financial year in the format `YYYY/YY`.


## match_area()

`match_area()` converts geography codes into area names.


## postcode()

`postcode()` formats improperly recorded postcodes.


## Quarters

This section contains the `qtr()`, `qtr_end()`, `qtr_next()`, and `qtr_prev()` which are used to assign dates to quarters.
